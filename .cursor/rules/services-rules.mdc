# Services Layer Rules

- Each service file should be named `[model].service.ts` and placed in the `server/services/` directory.
- Implement async functions for each CRUD operation, calling the corresponding repository functions:
  - `createModel`
  - `getModel`
  - `updateModel`
  - `deleteModel`
  - `getAllModelPaginated` (if applicable)
- Service functions should receive validated input (from the schema layer) and return the result of repository operations.
- Business logic, if any, should be placed here (not in the repository or router).
- Export all service functions for use in the router layer.
